			<h4>The Design Phase(Algorithm)</h4>
			<p>The design phase is one of the most important and usually difficult stage. One tool used to design the program is the algorithm. With an algorithm the steps required to 				carry out a given task are clearly described. The algorithm will include instructions for how to:
				<ul>
    				<li>accept information</li>
    				<li>display information</li>
    				<li>transformations</li>
    				<li>how to select decisions</li>
    				<li>how to repeat sub-tasks</li>
    				<li>when to terminate</li>
    			</ul>	
				Writing musical score is an algorithm where the notes express tasks. For programming though an algorithm is expressed using English-like instructions. An algorithm is 					independent of the programming language or the computer hardware to be used, but influenced. A programming language acts like a convenient medium for expressing 					algorithm and the computer is simply the medium of execution. The solution process expressed as an algorithm can not obviously be executed since computers do not handle 					well the idiosyncrasies of a natural language or subset of it (but moving towards it)
